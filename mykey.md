# myKEY #

You will need a myKEY to enrol and to access Compensation Web Applications, access your pay stubs, encrypt documents on your desktop, send and receive encrypted email messages and securely connect to the Government of Canada’s Secure Remote Access. The myKEY program enhances the online security of communications and transactions by and between Government of Canada employees. 

## How to get a myKEY ##

If you do not have a myKEY, or if yours has expired or become inactive (which happens when you do not use it for several months), you can:
- use the [Online Registration and Credential Administration (ORCA)](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/bienvenue-welcome-eng.pub) system to manage your myKEY

### To register for a myKEY using ORCA: ###

If an LRA created your myKEY, you can import it into ORCA. This will let you use ORCA to perform your own recovery if you forget your password or your myKEY expires.

To begin in ORCA, click on “[myKEY sign up](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/bienvenue-welcome-eng.pub)”.

1. If you already have an Entrust profile, click on “Import LRA Created myKEY” and follow the prompts.
2. If you do not have an Entrust profile and are a new user, sign-up and provide your personal information, such as name, email, address, personal identification number (PRI) and date of birth.
3. If you received your myKEY using ORCA, you can use the system to recover your myKEY.
4. If you are on secondment to TC, go to [“ORCA for Seconded Employees”](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/affectation-secondment-eng.pub), click on [myKEY Sign Up](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/s/rg/inscription-registration-eng.pub) and complete the registration form.

**Remember:** Your **myKEY** password must comply with the [Strong Password](http://mytc/how-do-i-create-a-strong-password-3125.html) policy. If you have trouble accessing the ORCA page or enrolling, please contact the Service Desk at 613-991-8908 or your [regional support unit (RSU)](http://mytc/technical-support-and-resources.html).
