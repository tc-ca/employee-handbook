# Access/ID Cards #

**What is my Access/ID Card?**

All persons employed by or otherwise engaged by Transport Canada, including students and persons on contract, loan, or temporary assignment, are issued a TC identification card. The identification card will be issued only after the required pre-employment security screening checks have been completed.

The Identification/access cards are easy to use. The employee requiring access presents the card to the card reader, located next to an entry door (or controlled access point). The reader reads the card and unlocks the door (or access is granted by security personnel monitoring the card reader).

**Forgot your Access/ID Card?**

Employees who forget their identification/access cards can obtain a temporary card from the Commissioner desk on the main floor. This card will be issued for 1 working day only and must be returned at the end of the day

**Employee card responsibilities**

- Employees and visitors are expected to visibly wear the ID cards
- Employees are to escort their Visitor(s) while within the building.
- Lost or stolen ID cards must be reported to the Regional Director, Corporate Services (RDCS) in the Regions and to the Pass Control Office in the National Capital Region.
- Employees terminating their employment with TC must return their identification card to the RDCS in the Regions or to the Pass Control Office in the National Capital Region.
