## Approval for software download ##

1. Send an email to your manager stating the software you require to be downloaded onto your computer and the reasoning for the software.
2. Wait until you receive an email back from your manager approving the software. Once an approval is received, fill out a [Software Request Form.](http://mytc.tc.gc.ca/how-do-i-request-software-or-hardware-for-my-workstation-5797.html)
3. After the Form is completed and submitted to the Service Desk, you will receive an automated email from the Service Desk with a ticket #. Forward this email to your manager.
4. Your manager will then forward this to an approval team.
5. You will receive an email from the IT approval team with a statement of approval and any conditions relating to the use of the software along with Service/Help Desk reference ticket numbers. A LAN admin will then contact you to schedule a time to install the software for you. 

\* If you have Admin access you may download the software yourself once the statement of approval has been received from the IT approval team.
