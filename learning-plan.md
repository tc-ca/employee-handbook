    Be totally honest when comparing your capabilities with the requirements of your job and public service learning priorities.
    Create a learning network with other like-minded people to keep yourself motivated.
    Get feedback from your manager.



## Learning Plan FAQ's ##

**Who does required training apply to?**

Required training applies to newly appointed employees to the public service (with the exception of casual employees) whose term is more than six months, and those who maybe in an acting position for more than four months. For more information, please see Transport Canada’s information on required training, or the Treasury Board Secretariat’s Directive on the Administration of Required Training. 

**How does the Learning and Development Plan (LDP) process fit into a long-range plan?** 

You must complete a Learning and Development Plan every year. If the learning activity you want to do cover more than one year, you should fill out your Learning and Development Plan accordingly. 

**Do travel expenses have to be factored into the cost of the course listed on my Learning and Development Plan, or does this come out of another budget?** 

Travel and accommodation costs do come out of a separate budget, but you still have to include them in your Learning and Development Plan so that your manager knows that the course will cost more than just the registration fee or tuition. 

**If I take courses outside of work (that have been pre-approved as part of my Learning and Development Plan), do I have to pay for them up front?**

Yes, if you take pre-approved courses outside of work, you have to pay for them up front and then get reimbursed once you complete them. To get reimbursed, you must submit original invoices, as well as proof of successful completion of the course. There may be exceptions for some courses (like an MBA) where payment in advance could cause you financial difficulties and your manager can approve payment in advance. For more information on exceptions, speak with your manager.
