# Learning Activity Request (LAR) #

You must use a Learning Activity Request (LAR) form to get approval for most learning activities before you register for them. 

**To fill out a LAR form:**

1. Launch the Citrix Receiver
2. Click on the BIRM portal icon (red ball) in the Citrix Receiver window. If you do not see this icon, please contact your local technical support team.
3. In the “My Learning” box, click on “Complete My Learning Activity Request Form (LAR)”.
4. Fill in your LAR form. 

**Submit your form**

5. Click the Submit button. You will automatically get an acknowledgment that your form has been submitted. 
6. Approval is still pending at this point. You cannot register for a learning activity until you get an approval email from your manager. 

Here are a few tips:

    There is a two-hour time limit to complete the form. After that, you will have to start over.
    Some fields will already be filled in for you based on your User ID (like your contact information).
    You must fill in fields marked with a red asterisk (*).
    You can search fields that have a flashlight icon (by clicking on the flashlight).
    Fields with an arrow have a drop-down list. Click on the arrow to see the list.
