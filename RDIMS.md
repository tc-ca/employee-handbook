 RDIMS, which is the acronym for Records, Document and Information Management System, is the Canadian government’s electronic document and record management solution (EDRMS). RDIMS DM (Document Management) enables the management of information by helping you to store, protect, and share information resources of business value in accordance with TC business needs and Government of Canada IM legislative and policy requirements. It is mandatory to use RDIMS DM to preserve information resources of business value. On the basis of legislative and policy provisions, all TC employees are required to document their business activities and decisions and ensure that information resources of business value are identified and stored in official corporate repositories

TC staff have been using RDIMS DM to manage TC's information assets since 1999. There are now over 9 million official records in the RDIMS DM Repository.
