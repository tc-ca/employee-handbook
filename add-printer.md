# Add a printer #

In order to map a printer do the following: 
* click on network>type \\ncrps300   in the search bar and this will bring up all the printers on the network 
* add PRN21C5 for main B&W printer
* add PRN21B1 for colour printer

The colour printer will default to black and white. When printing a document, you will have to change it to the full colour setting in the printer properties and then in colour options. This setting is only available on the specified colour printers.
