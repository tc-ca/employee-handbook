# Employee Handbook #

*The purpose of this handbook is to facilitate a positive onboarding experience for you into our team at Transport Canada. As described in this guide, the onboarding experience can be best broken down into stages. Below you will find checklists you can use at each stage to ensure you feel welcomed and integrated into our new team as quickly and smoothly as possible.*

**Pre-Arrival**
* Stay in regular contact with your manager, especially if there is a long period between the job offer and the start date.
* Let your manager know if you require any special workplace accommodations.
* Shortly before your start date, you should receive your letter of offer, a welcome email, a workplace information package and this orientation guide.
* Before your first day, make sure you are clear about the location, contact information and the date and expected time of your arrival.

**Do I need to bring anything on my first day?**
